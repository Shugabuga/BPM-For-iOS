# PonyMotes for iOS

## About
This is an iOS port for BetterPonyMotes, a popular browser extension that brings thousands of emotes to Reddit. This port requires the user to get Alien Blue (somehow) because it is the only iOS app that supports emotes (as far as I know).

## Install
Drop the `BPM.theme` folder into the `/Library/Themes` directory and apply with **Anemone**. *WinterBoard may not work*.

## License
PonyMotes for iOS is licensed under the AGPL v3.
